CodeBook

This Codebook gives information on variables of the Tidy dataset, a brief description of each variable including the units of measurement. In the end, it also gives a brief description of the transformations that were made to clean up the data and produce a tidy dataset.

The following steps were performed to produce the Tidy.txt file as the required output for this Course project:

Download the data using the link "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip".
Unzip the file and save the dataset in the working directory.
Load the Test and Training datasets along with the features and activity_labels using read.table function.
Merge the Test and Training datasets into one dataset using rbind function.
Name the variables of the mergedDataset with names from features.txt and add subject and activity columns to the merged Dataset.
Extract only the columns with measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Make a dataframe called "RequiredDataset" with subject,activity and meanSTD columns.
Replace the Activity Ids with activity labels.
Label the variable names of the "RequiredDataset" with descriptive names. 10.Using plyr package and ddply function, create a final, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 11.Using write.table function create a Tidy.txt file in the working directory.
